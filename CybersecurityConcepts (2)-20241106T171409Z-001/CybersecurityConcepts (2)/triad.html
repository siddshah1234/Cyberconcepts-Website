        <p>The CIA Triad is commonly mistaken for the government agency with the same name. However, the CIA Triad represents </p>
        <p> 3 core pillars in Cybersecurity needed to protect information effectively. The pillars in the triad are:  </p>
    
        <br>
        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p><b>Confidentiality</b> means protecting data so only authorized people can access it. This can be done with tools</p>
        <p>such as passwords, encryption, and access controls to keep information private.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p><b>Integrity</b> is about making sure data is accurate and not altered by unauthorized people. Checks such as digital</p>
        <p>signatures and version control help ensure that the data stays correct over time.</p>
        
        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p><b>Availability</b> means making sure data and systems are available to those who need it. Regular maintenance, backups, </p>
        <p>and secure systems help keep information accessible, even during problems like power outages or cyberattacks.</p>
        
        <h2>Importance of the CIA Triad</h2>
        <p>By following these three principles, organizations can protect data, follow legal requirements, and reduce security risks.</p>
