        <h1 class="secondheader">Phishing</h1>
        <p>Phishing is a cyberattack that tricks people into sharing sensitive data or downloading harmful software. It's a type </p>
        <p>of social engineering that targets human errors. Phishing attacks often use fake emails, texts, or websites to convince users</p>
        <p>to reveal personal information like passwords or financial details.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>
        <p><b>Bulk Email Phishing:</b> Attackers send fake emails to large groups of people, hoping that a few will respond. These emails </p>
        <p>often appear to be from well-known brands to look legitimate.</p>
    
        <p><b>Spear Phishing:</b> This is a targeted phishing attack that focuses on a specific individual or group. The attacker uses</p>
        <p>personal information about the target to make the message seem more credible. For example, they might pose as a school principal </p>
        <p>in an email asking for personal information to qualify for an award.</p>
        
        <p><b>Smishing and Vishing:</b> Smishing uses SMS messages, and vishing involves voice calls to trick victims. Scammers might pose </p>
        <p>as a bank or government agency to request financial details over the phone or text.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Recognize Phishing Attempts</h2>
        <p>Phishing scams often use certain tactics to create urgency or appeal to emotions. Some warning signs include:</p>
        <p><b>Suspicious URLs:</b> Fake URLs may look similar to real websites but often have small differences, like extra letters or misspellings.</p>
        <p><b>Urgent Language:</b> Messages might pressure you to act immediately, like "Update your account now!" or "Your account will be suspended."</p>
        <p><b>Requests for Sensitive Data:</b> Legitimate companies rarely ask for personal or financial information through email or text. If unsure, contact the company directly.</p>
