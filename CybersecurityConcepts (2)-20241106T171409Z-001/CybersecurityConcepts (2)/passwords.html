        <h1 class="secondheader">Passwords</h1>
        <p>Passwords are crucial when it comes to protecting online accounts and sensitive information. Strong, unique passwords</p>
        <p>are essential for keeping hackers out of your personal data. Here are some guidelines for creating effective passwords:</p>
        
        <h2>Characteristics of a Strong Password</h2>
        <p><b>Long:</b> Passwords should be at least 12 characters. The longer the password, the harder it is for hackers to guess.</p>
        <p><b>Unique:</b> Each account should have its own password to prevent a single data breach from compromising multiple accounts.</p>
        <p>Avoid reusing passwords, even with minor differences.</p>
        <p><b>Complex:</b> Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>

        <h2>Changing Passwords:</h2>
        <p>Regularly changing your passwords will probably be unnessary if your password is already strong, </p>
        <p>unless you suspect your password has been compromised. </p>
        
        <h2>Password Management</h2>
        <p>Managing your passwords can often be difficult. Using a password manager can offer you a secure way to store and manage  </p>
        <p>passwords, so you only need to remember one master password. This helps reduce potential of being hacked because of password reuse.</p>
