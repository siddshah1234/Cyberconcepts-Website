        <h1 class="secondheader">The Three "States" of Data</h1>
        
        <p>In cybersecurity, data exists in three main states: at rest, in transit, and in use. Understanding each states </p>
        <p>is important for protecting data effectively.</p>
        
        <h2>Data at Rest</h2>
        <p><b>Data at Rest</b> refers to inactive data stored on physical or digital storage, like hard drives, databases,</p>
        <p> or USB drives. Protection at this stage involves encrypting the storage media, making it unreadable without</p>
        <p>the right decryption key. Techniques like full-disk encryption, file-level encryption, and Digital Rights Management</p>
        <p>helps protect data even when it's not actively being accessed.</p>
        
        <h2>Data in Transit</h2>
        <p><b>Data in Transit</b> describes data moving between locations, like emails, file transfers, or data sent through</p>
        <p>messaging apps. Since this data is exposed while being transmitted, encryption is used to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>Common protections include email encryption and Managed File Transfer systems, which secure data from being intercepted</p>
        <p>or altered during transfer.</p>
        
        <h2>Data in Use</h2>
        <p><b>Data in Use</b> is data actively used by applications or users. Protecting data in use is challenging because it needs</p>
        <p>to be decrypted for access. Access control tools, like Role-Based Access Control and Identity Management, help ensure that</p>
        <p>only authorized users can access or modify data. Additionally, digital rights management can limit what users can do with data,</p>
        <p>such as preventing editing or printing sensitive documents.</p>
