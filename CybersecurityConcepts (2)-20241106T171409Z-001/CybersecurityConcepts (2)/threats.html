        <h1 class="secondheader">Potential Threats</h1>
        <p>Cyber threats are constantly evolving as attackers develop new methods to breach security</p>
        <p>and exploit vulnerabilities. Here are some of the most common types of cyber threats organizations and individuals face:</p>

        <h2>Malware</h2>
        <p><b>Malware</b> is designed to damage or disrupt systems. It can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.</p> 
        <p>Common types include viruses, spyware, and trojans. Malware can steal information or damage files and software.</p>

        <h2>Ransomware</h2>
        <p><b>Ransomware</b> encrypts a victim's data, making it inaccessible until a ransom is paid. This type of malware has become increasingly</p>
        <p>popular due to its high financial return for attackers. Preventing ransomware attacks requires regular data backups, employee training,</p>
        <p>and strong security protocols.</p>
    
        <h2>Distributed Denial of Service Attacks</h2>
        <p><b>DDoS attacks</b> flood a target's network with excessive traffic, overwhelming systems and making online services unavailable.</p> 
        <p>These attacks often serve as distractions for other types of cyber attacks and can be very disruptive for organizations, especially </p>
        <p>those relying heavily on online services.</p>
    
        <h2>Corporate Account Takeover</h2>
        <p><b>Corporate Account Takeover</b> involves cybercriminals gaining unauthorized access to a business's financial accounts.</p>
        <p>Attackers can commit fraudulent transactions during Corporate Account Takeover. Businesses with weak security measures</p>
        <p>are particularly vulnerable to this type of attack.</p>
    
        <h2>ATM Cash-Out</h2>
        <p><b>ATM Cash-Out</b> is a type of fraud where attackers use stolen card information to make large, unauthorized cash withdrawals from ATMs.</p>
        <p>They may change ATM settings to allow "Unlimited Operations," resulting in large financial losses for banks and other financial institutions.</p>
    
        <h2>Protecting Against Cyber Threats</h3>
        <p>Organizations and individuals can reduce cyber risks by implementing strong security measures, such as updating software, limiting access to </p>
        <p>sensitive data, and educating employees about cybersecurity best practices. Being aware of these threats and taking steps can help</p>
        <p>defend against potential attacks.</p>
