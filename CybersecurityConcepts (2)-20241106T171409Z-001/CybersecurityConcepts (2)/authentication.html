        <h1 class="secondheader">Different Types of Authentication</h1>
        
        
        <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users trying to access a system. Authentication</p>
        <p>is important because secure authentication methods are needed to protect sensitive data. Here are five common types of authentication:</p>
        
        <h2>Password-Based Authentication</h2>
        <p><b>Multi-Factor Authentication</b> is one of the most common forms of authentication, requiring users to enter a unique password. </p>
        <p>While it's easy to use, it's also vulnerable to phishing and hacking if passwords are weak or reused across accounts.</p>
        
        <h2>Multi-Factor Authentication</h2>
        <p><b>Multi-Factor Authentication</b> adds extra layers to the login process. In addition to a password, users need to provide a </p>
        <p>second verification method, such as a code from their phone or a fingerprint scan. MFA increases security but may still have </p>
        <p>issues if users lose their phone or another verification device.</p>
        
        <h2>Certificate-Based Authentication</h2>
        <p><b>Certificate-Based Authentication</b> uses digital certificates to confirm a user's identity. These certificates, similar to </p>
        <p>digital ID cards, contain encrypted data about the user and are verified by a trusted authority. This method is secure but requires</p>
        <p>careful management of the certificates.</p>
        
        <h2>Biometric Authentication</h2>
        <p><b>Biometric Authentication</b> relies on biological traits like fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice patterns to identify users. </p>
        <p>This approach is convenient because it doesn't require remembering passwords, but it may sometimes be inaccurate if external factors </p>
        <p>interfere, like low lighting for facial scans.</p>
        
        <h2>Token-Based Authentication</h2>
        <p><b>Token-Based Authentication</b> provides users with a unique token, an encrypted string, after they log in. This token can then </p>
        <p>be used to access systems without repeatedly entering login information. Commonly used for APIs, tokens are secure but must be carefully </p>
        <p>managed to avoid unauthorized access.</p>
